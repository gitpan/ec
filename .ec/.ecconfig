# EC SETTINGS AND OPTIONS.
#
#
# Lines that start with '#' are comments and are not 
# part of the configuration.  
#
# Options have the form: 
#   keyword value
#
# If <value> contains spaces, enclose it in quotes; e.g.; 
#
#   keyword "value"
#
# For most options, if the option is not specified, then a built-in 
# default value is used. 
#
#
# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
#
# Fonts - X11 fonts to use for message text, message header fields,
# and menus and widgets.  Each font option should contain enough of 
# a X Logical Font Descriptor (XLFD) to uniquely identify a font.  
# The program "xfontsel" can preview fonts on your system, and "xlsfonts"
# can list the available fonts on the system.  Consult the man pages
# of these programs for further information.
#

headerfont *-courier-medium-i-*-*-12-*
menufont *-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*
#
# Your mail domain at the ISP.  Generally this is the part of 
# your e-mail address after the '@'.  User name for each server
# is set in the .servers file.  maildomain defaults to 'localhost'.
#
maildomain mainmatter.com
#
# Port numbers for POP3 and SMTP servers must be set in the 
# .servers file.  EC uses the SMTP port number here to determine 
# which is the SMTP server and which are the POP server(s).  POP3 
# servers generally use port 110. The SMTP port number here
# should be 25, unless you have a special configuration.  
#
smtpport 25
#
#
# SENDMAIL OPTIONS
#
# If you want to use a local sendmail as your MTA, set this
# to non-zero.
#
usesendmail 0
#
# If 'usesendmail' is set, set 'sendmailprog' to the complete path 
# of the sendmail program.  If you have a dial-up connection and your 
# system does not have a name server, you should probably set the mail 
# domain name (the one in the 'maildomain' option, above) in the 
# /etc/mail/sendmail.cf file; e.g.,
#
#   Djmainmatter.com
#
# Also, you'll probably need to set the "smarthost" option 
# in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf if your local sendmail is not configured 
# to relay messages (recent versions of sendmail are configured not 
# to relay by default); e.g:
#
#   DSsmtp:mail.your-isp-net
# 
# and make sure that your hostname resolves to your mail domain.  For 
# further details, refer to the Sendmail Installation and Operation 
# Guide in the Sendmail source code distribution, or one of the many 
# commercial books that describe Sendmail configuration.
#
sendmailprog /usr/sbin/sendmail
#
# If using sendmail, use the -f option to set the sender address
# to your login@maildomain.  This is sometimes useful on dial-up 
# connections, if you also use sendmail for local delivery or don't
# allow masquerading. The -f command line  option also causes 
# sendmail to place a X-Authentication-Warning: line in the message 
# header. It's better to use sendmail's 'always_add_domain' option when 
# you build the sendmail.cf file, if possible.
#
sendmailsetfrom 1
#
# When using the -f option with sendmail, what domain mailbox
# name (a complete, valid email address), should be used on
# the command line.  In many cases this will be your login name
# to the ISP's SMTP server, if different than your login name
# on this system.
#

#
#
# QMAIL OPTIONS
#
# If you want to use a local qmail as your MTA, set this line
# to non-zero.
#
useqmail 0
#
# Set this to the path of qmail-inject.  The default is ''.
#

# Name of the .signature file that is appended to outgoing messages.  
# If not specified, defaults to $HOME/.signature 
#

#
# Attach the sig file defined above.
#

#
# If you always make Fcc copies of your messages, set the default 
# value of the Fcc: field here. Defaults to ~/Mail/outgoing .  You
# can still set a different file name in the Fcc: field of an 
# outgoing message.
#
fccfile Mail/outgoing
#
# Name of system mail spool directory.  
# Your system mailbox name is a concatenation of this directory and 
# your login name. On Linux machines the directory is usually 
# /var/spool/mail ; On Solaris machines it is /var/mail.  If 
# your local MTA is qmail, use your home directory here - either
# the full path, or ~user format, and also set 'useqmail',
# above, to non-zero, and 'qmailbox' to the name of
# your Mailbox.  Defaults to /var/spool/mail/.
#
mailspooldir /var/spool/mail
#
# Default top-level directory for saved messages. Defaults to ~/Mail .
#

# Web browser - Netscape versions 4.x, lynx, and Opera 5.0 are supported.
# Netscape Version 6 and Mozilla should work but haven't been tested.  
# Amaya is tested with version 2.4.  The value should be the browser 
# executable program's name. Make sure the browser program is in one of 
# the directories in $PATH, or specify the complete path name of the 
# browser program here, for example, /usr/local/netscape/netscape or 
# /usr/X11R6/bin/opera.  If the browser is lynx, make sure that the options 
# for xterm, below, are set correctly.

#
# Mail Filters - Define how to sort incoming messages.  Each
# line is composed of a text pattern and the folder in which 
# messages that contain the text pattern should be saved, with 
# two equals signs "==" separating the two expressions.  If an 
# incoming message doesn't match any pattern, it is saved in the 
# default Incoming folder.  Patterns are not passed through the 
# quotemeta function nor receive any precompiling, which means 
# that you have to quote any characters with a backslash that have 
# special meanings in Perl (especially '@'-signs, brackets
# '<', '>', '[', and ']' ).  Periods as metacharacters match 
# anything, including themselves.  Matches are case insensitive.
# Make sure there is a newline after the last filter entry -
# a nearly unavoidable Unix-ism.
