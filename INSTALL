EC Email Client -- Installation

This is beta software.  Please send comments to the author, 
rkiesling@mainmatter.com

NOTE: As of Version 0.90, EC stores some of its library
modules in the directory ~/.ec/EC/.  If you edit the path
names in the main program file, you will also need to edit
them in the library modules, especially ~/.ec/EC/Config.pm.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

You will need, in addition to Perl:

1. A recent version of Perl/Tk.

INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING

1.  Unpack the tar archive, preferably in your home directory 
    (which you've already done it you're reading this).

    tar zxvf ec-<version>.tar.gz

2.  Edit the file ~/.ec/.servers (it's a hidden file in a hidden
    directory) so it contains the names of your ISP's POP and SMTP 
    servers, and your user name and password for each.  Refer to 
    the help documentation on EC's help menu for details.  

    If you're really paranoid about saving passwords in a file, 
    enter a hyphen ('-') in the space for the password, and ec will 
    prompt you for the password each time it tries to connect to 
    that server.

3.  Edit the ~/.ec/.ecconfig file with the program options of 
    your choice.  

4.  On Solaris systems, you may need to change the value of 
    $SOCK_STREAM line 39 to '2' to communicate directly with
    SMTP and POP3 servers.  

5.  EC requires, at the very least, a top-level mail subdirectory, 
    and two sub-sub-directories, one for incoming mail and another 
    for trash.  Create the directories defined in the default 
    configuration with the following commands:

    cd 
    mkdir Mail
    mkdir Mail/incoming
    mkdir Mail/trash

PRINTING THE DOCUMENTATION

It is possible produce this documentation in various formats
using Perl's POD formatting utilities:

  pod2html <ec >doc.html
  pod2latex <ec >doc.tex
  pod2man <ec >doc.man
  pod2text <ec >doc.txt
  pod2usage <ec >doc.msg

Refer to your system's manual pages for instructions of how
to use these utilities.

That's it!  If EC doesn't work for some reason, please let the 
author know.  Please send bug reports, suggestions, and other
feedback to rkiesling@mainmatter.com.
